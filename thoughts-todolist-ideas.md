# Ideas

- Auto file backup (like newly taken pictures or smth it automatically uploads it to the cloud in a folder /TelephoneUpload/(the same path that it was on the phone) or if you set photos/videos to go in s3t folders by you that would be also available, same on pc add the upload function (of course only if you want it and you set where to upload from (what folder) if not set then /PCUpload/(the same path) and yeah)
- native app (like a desktop app) (maybe electron or something like that)
- native app (like a mobile app) (maybe react native or something like that) (kinda added because of the manifest.json which just basically downloads the app as a site and is a pwa not a react native app)
<!-- - Ads (maybe very maybe) (i really don't want it) -->
- sharing files/folders
- checking newest version of project upon starting (if there is a new version then try to update, if its a safety and security update then block the app from starting and force the user to update or auto force update, if the app is running offline then notify that the user is running this project on there own risk for security purposes and that they should update when they are online if there is a new version)
